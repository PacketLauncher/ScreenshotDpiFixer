Tool for downscaling taken screenshots on high-dpi displays to 100%

If you're using a high-res monitor, such as 4K displays, and Windows scale and layout setting is set above 100%, you might have found that taking screenshots and pasting them in social medias or in other applications are too big. This tool comes to aid for this very issue!

This app runs in the system tray and detects any screenshot taken on the system. If it finds that scaling is set above 100%, it will notify you and suggest a 100% version of the image, replacing the larger one in the clipboard.

How to use:
-----------
Once launching the app, it will show up in the system tray along with the other icons. By default, it shows you a balloon notification about the current size of the taken screenshot, and suggest a 100% version of it by clicking on the balloon, which will replace the high-dpi image in the clipboard.

If you'd like it to automatically scale the image to 100% without needing to click on the balloon, just right-click on the app in the tray icons and check the 'Auto scale to 100%' option.
